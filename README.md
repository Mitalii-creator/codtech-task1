Overview of the Java Simple Calculator
1. Project Objective: The primary goal of this project is to develop a simple command-line calculator using Java. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Features:

Basic Operations: The calculator supports four operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
User Input: Users can input two numbers and select an operation.
Error Handling: The application handles division by zero and invalid input gracefully.
3. Design and Implementation:

Programming Language: Java
Development Environment: Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command-line interface.
Structure: The project consists of a main class that handles user interactions and performs calculations.
4. Code Breakdown:

Main Class: Contains the main method, where the program execution begins.
Scanner Class: Utilized for taking user input.
Methods for Operations: Separate methods for each arithmetic operation improve code readability and organization.

5. Conclusion: This simple calculator demonstrates basic programming concepts in Java, such as user input handling, control flow, and method usage. It serves as a foundation for more complex projects and enhances problem-solving skills.
